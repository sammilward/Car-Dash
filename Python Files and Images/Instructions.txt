Move the car from lane to lane to survive and avoid the oncoming traffic. Manoeuvre the car using the arrow keys on the keyboard. Use the left and right arrows to go into the corresponding lanes at the side.  To return to the centre lane use the upwards arrow. If you hit another car the game will end instantly and your score will be saved. You will earn one point for every second you survive; an additional five points will be added to your total score for every coin that you collect. RACE ON!
